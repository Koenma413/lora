# Requirements

# How to hack it?
----------

Lora uses postgresql database as its backend, and hugo for builing. It is based on Beego framework
and is written in go programming language a.k.a golang

I assume you have a working golang environment you can skip this part if its true, if not I have included a script `setup.sh` which helps
install golang and sets up the environment for you. To setup do the following.

    $ git clone 
    $ cd lora
    $ chmod +x setup.sh
    $ ,/setup.sh
    
Then relax the heavy golang setup will  be done for you.

Now you can hack on lora whatever you want and if you are done build your work with the `build.sh` script

    $ cd /path/to/lora
    $ chmod +x build.sh
    $ ./build.sh

Which will create a binary `lora` at the current working directory
you can then execute by command `./lora`. Visit `http://localhost:4567` to view your site.

Remember to read `conf/app.config` and change it to suit your needs

Lora usess compass and sass for generating `css` If you want to hack on the styles, make sure sass and compass
is installed and you can run the command `compass watch` and enjoy hacking.
