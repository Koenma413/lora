Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome. 

Before writing code, send mail to geofreyernest@live.com to discuss what you
plan to do. This gives me a chance to validate the design, avoid duplication of
effort and ensure that the changes fit the goals of the project. Do not start
the discussion with a pull request.
